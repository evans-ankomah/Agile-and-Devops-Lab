1. Overview
 
Objective
To demonstrate that you can independently apply Agile principles and DevOps practices to plan, execute, and iteratively deliver a working solution.

Assessment Brief
You will individually design, plan, and deliver a small working prototype or service over two simulated sprints. The emphasis is not on the size of the product, but on how well you apply Agile and DevOps practices throughout the entire process.

Project Structure & Instructions
You will follow a structure of three sprints: one for planning (Sprint 0) and two for execution (Sprints 1 & 2).

2. Sprint 0: Planning (Setup)
Your goal in this sprint is to prepare your entire project for execution.

Define a Product Vision: Write 1-2 sentences for your prototype.

Create a Product Backlog: Write at least 5 user stories.

Refine the Backlog: For each story, add acceptance criteria. Prioritize the backlog and estimate the effort (using story points or relative sizing).

Establish Standards: Define your team's "Definition of Done" (DoD).

Plan Sprint 1: Select 2-3 stories from your backlog to complete in Sprint 1.

3. Sprint 1: Execution
 
Your goal in this sprint is to deliver your first increment of working software and establish your DevOps pipeline.

Deliver Work: Complete and deliver at least 2 of your planned backlog items.

Use Version Control: You must use Git and have a commit history that reflects iterative, incremental delivery (no "big-bang" commits at the end).

Set up CI/CD: Implement a basic CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

Implement Testing: Write and integrate unit or integration tests that run in your pipeline.

Conduct a Sprint Review: Produce a document or short demo (e.g., screenshots, write-up) showing what you delivered.

Conduct a Retrospective: Write a reflection identifying at least 2 specific improvements for your process in Sprint 2.

4. Sprint 2: Execution & Improvement
 
Your goal in this sprint is to apply feedback and deliver the next increment.

Apply Feedback: Implement the process improvements you identified in your Sprint 1 Retrospective.

Deliver Work: Complete and deliver at least 2 more backlog items.

Add Monitoring: Add basic monitoring or logging to your application (e.g., console logs, error tracking, a simple health endpoint).

Conduct a Sprint Review: Produce a document or demo for the work completed in this sprint.

Conduct a Final Retrospective: Write a final reflection on your process, including improvements and key lessons learned.

5. Final Deliverables
 
You must submit all of the following artifacts:

Backlog & Sprint Plans: Your complete product backlog, sprint plans, user stories, estimates, and Definition of Done.

Codebase: A link to your code repository (e.g., GitHub) showing your full commit history.

CI/CD Evidence: Your pipeline configuration file (e.g., main.yml) and screenshots or logs of successful (and failed) pipeline runs.

Testing Evidence: Your test files and screenshots of test results.

Sprint Review Documents: Your demos, screenshots, or write-ups for both Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.

Retrospectives: Your written reflections for both Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.

6. Submission & Grading Rubric
Dimension	Weight	What Good Looks Like
Agile Practice	25%	Clear backlog, prioritization, acceptance criteria, and proper sprint planning.
DevOps Practice	25%	CI/CD pipeline is working, tests are integrated, and basic monitoring/logging is included.
Delivery Discipline	20%	Commit history reflects iterative work (no "big-bang" commits at the end).
Prototype Quality	20%	The solution is working and meets the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories.
Reflection	10%	Retrospectives show meaningful improvement and lessons learned between Sprint 1 & 2.
